# OpGL_Exercise
Open GL exercise from a school project - Computer Graphics
Implementing the Bresenham algorithm to draw a line and circle for the desired points.
### Setup
* OpenGL is deprecated on newer MacOS so it might not work on yours.
* Xcode ––> Project Settings ––> Targets 
* Add 2 Frameworks for this to build & run
* OpenGL & GLUT Framework

Before doing these exercise learn how Bresenham algorith works!

#### Exercise 1
* Implement a Bresenham algorithm to draw a line
* The result should draw pixelated (staircase) 3 lines with different colors

#### Exercise 2
* Implement a Bresengam algorith to draw a circle
* The result should draw a pixelated circle. 
* *I should fix the bug where theres pixel missing for each section not being drawn?*
